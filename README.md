## ETL-R-Covid19-Italy

Under construction

The aim of this project is to provide one ETL dataset, from the Italian Covid19 public databases and other sources, containing some most important transformations and new features engeneered.

These variables have the intent - but don't want to be exhaustives - a semi-ready-to-use csv file for all kind of analysis, as Times Series, Statistics, Machine Learing, Deep Learning tecniques.
